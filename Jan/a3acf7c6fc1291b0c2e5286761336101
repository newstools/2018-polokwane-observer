The provincial leadership of the Congress of the People (Cope) had their sights set on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development this morning as they converged on the headquarters in Biccard Street in Polokwane about an hour ago with a letter of request for a meeting with acting MEC Seaparo Sekoati.
Interim Cope provincial leader Makgwana Rampedi and Provincial Secretary Erick Mohlapamaswi indicated that they intended handing over a letter directed to the acting Agriculture and Rural Development MEC with the request to discuss problems relating to the government’s Fetša Tlala programme on behalf of an agricultural structure in Sebayeng. The issues were initially raised by Sebayeng Community Agriculture during a recent meeting with Cope deputy leader Willie Madisha, who was accompanied by the provincial leadership, it was learnt.
