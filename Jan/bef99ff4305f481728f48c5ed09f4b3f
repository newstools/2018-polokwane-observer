The Purple team of Jabez Christian Academy emerged as the winner on points when they beat the Green team during the school’s house athletics at Hoër Tegniese Skool Tom Naudé last Friday. The Purple team scored 37 points and the Green team 19.
Learners gave their best at discus, javelin, high and long jump as well as track running over distances from 60 to
1 500 m. Newly appointed Deputy Principal Bruce Phillips made the announcements and ensured that the spirits remain high as supporters cheered the athletes on their way to the winning post.
Principal Elana Erasmus the day was a great success and offered new learners an opportunity to socialise and make new friends.
