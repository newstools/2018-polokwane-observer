Polokwane magistrate Janine Ungerer ruled earlier today (Friday) that she will need time until 2 February to work through an abundance of evidence before giving judgement in the case of double murder accused Rameez Patel.
State prosecutor Mashudu Mudau and defence attorney Tumi Mokwena gave final arguments on why Patel should be granted bail or not.
Patel is not only accused for allegedly killing his mother Mahjebeen at her home in Nirvana in September but also stands trial for the killing of his wife Fatima in April 2015. He is expected back in the Limpopo High Court to continue with his trial on 22 January.
