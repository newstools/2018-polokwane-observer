Following protests by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters and alleged damage to property at outlets of the Swedish clothing retail brand Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria early on Saturday morning, the Mall of the North outlet of H&M was closed on Saturday and Sunday as a preventative measure, but re-opened this morning (Monday) and carried on with business as usual.
This comes after H&M came under fire and has to face accusations of racism following the release of an image from its boys’ fashion range advertising a green hooded top that read ‘Coolest monkey in the jungle’. The model used was a young black boy.
Mall of the North General Manager, Sumari de Ridder said to Polokwane Observer that a group of about 25 EFF supporters gathered at the entrance of H&M on Saturday at 13:00 but did not enter the shop because it was closed. “Mall Management engaged with the protestors and it was agreed that they will disperse pending a meeting between H&M’s head office and the EFF on Wednesday. No damage was done and it did not affect other tenants or shoppers,” De Ridder confirmed.
Amelia-May Woudstra from H&M group’s press and communications department could not be reached for comment but reportedly said: “We sincerely apologise for offending customers with an image of a printed hooded top that was published on selected global online channels.”
