It was back to school for scores of Limpopo learners yesterday (Wednesday) while others started their 13-year journey behind school desks, an annual occasion that creates opportunity to capture the excitement and joy of little ones embarking on their school careers and in addition the heartache and anxiety of those reluctant to let go. Yesterday Polokwane Observer’s editorial team visited more than 20 schools in and around the city to obtain images of the events of 17 January 2018, which signify memorable calendar inscriptions in the diaries of many families. Armed with new school bags and some not-so-brave smiles, Polokwane’s Grade Rs posed for the photos to be shared in this edition and online publication.
