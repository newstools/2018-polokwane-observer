The management of New Horizon School for the Intellectually Impaired celebrated the physical ability of their learners during the school’s sport day on Friday.
The event provided learners with a platform to showcase their skill and talent in track and field events. As part of the celebrations the school’s drum majorette squad gave a performance that delighted the parents, relatives and fellow learners.
Educator Lizzie Vogel, who organised the event, said they wanted to show the parents how sport and physical activity can improve the lives of intellectually disabled persons. “We wanted to show the community the capability of our earners and quell the myth that disabled children cannot do what mainstream athletes can do,” Vogel explained.
She added that they wanted to promote and support the dignity of their learners and provide an opportunity for parents and extended family, community members and friends of the learners to come together and celebrate the learners.
