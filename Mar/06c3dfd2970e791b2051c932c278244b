Police made a major breakthrough during the continuation of Operation Fiela II when a dagga plantation was discovered and destroyed at Roossenekal on Monday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the dagga is worth R500 000 and was discovered after Police received a tip-off from community members.
The suspect allegedly ran away when Police arrived on the scene but according to Ngoepe the suspect is known and a manhunt has ensued.
Police used earthmoving equipment supplied by Elias Motswaledi Local Municipality to remove and destroy the plantation.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba applauded the Groblersdal Cluster on a job well done. “These are some of the achievements to be acknowledged showing a clear indication that we are winning the fight against the mushrooming of drugs in Limpopo. Members of the community are still encouraged to continue supporting the Police by providing information on any drug-related incidents,” Ledwaba said.
Anyone with information of the suspect on the run can contact investigating officer Manong Tshehla on 082 062 8235.
