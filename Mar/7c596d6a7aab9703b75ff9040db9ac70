Capricorn District Executive Mayor John Mpe was expected to visit the family of Happiness Gololo (37) on Tuesday after he allegedly drowned during the African National Congress (ANC) Polokwane Sub-Region’s Nelson Mandela Centenary Activities which included Mpe’s birthday celebrations at Molepo Dam in Mankweng on Saturday.
According to Mpe he did not know Gololo personally but was still saddened by the incident. “Gololo, who is from the Chuenes­poort area, arrived with a number of other people at the event. It is alleged that he immediately wanted to get into the water but was encouraged by his friends to refrain from going in.
“It is reported that Gololo sneaked into the dam at a later stage, got into trouble and drowned,” Mpe said, adding that he would assist the family with the funeral.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident saying that Gololo allegedly went for a swim when he drowned. The Police Search and Rescue Unit was called to the scene to retrieve the body. An inquest was registered, according to Ngoepe who once again cautioned members of the community to refrain from swimming in dams and rivers especially when they are not properly trained to swim.
