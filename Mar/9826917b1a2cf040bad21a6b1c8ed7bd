Polokwane Oval Raceway successfully hosted their first club championship of the year on Saturday after the event had to be rescheduled the previous week due to heavy rains.
Johan Swiegers was the first to be handed the chequered flag in the Super Midgets class while Tanieka Bent claimed victory in the Ninja Midgets class.
As Rookie driver Jeandré Nortjé showed no mercy towards his rivals while Shaun Keating kept ahead of his opponents in the Stockrods to achieve first position.

The highlight of every event, the Hotrods was ruled by WF Weideman while Schalk Smith claimed victory in the 1660s class.
