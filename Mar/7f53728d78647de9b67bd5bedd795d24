With the source of the recent nationwide listeria outbreak having been traced to the Polokwane facility of Enterprise Foods, a division of Tiger Brands, officials of the holding company are expected to meet with the National Consumer Commission (NCC) at 11:00 today (Monday) to come up with strategies to resolve the matter.
Tiger Brands has reportedly undertaken a full national recall of the affected Enterprise ready-to-eat meat product range and has suspended operations at its Enterprise manufacturing facilities in Polokwane and Germiston.
In a statement made available to Polokwane Observer today (Monday), Tiger Brands Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Mac Dougall advised consumers to remove any Enterprise ready-to-eat products from their fridges and place them in a plastic bag away from other products.
“We can confirm that we have, with immediate effect, undertaken a full national recall of the affected Enterprise ready-to-eat meat product range. We are being extra vigilant and cautious as consumer safety remains our highest priority and therefore immediate action is being taken. Additionally, we have suspended operations at both Enterprise manufacturing facilities in Polokwane and Germiston and have halted supply to trade,” Mac Dougall stated.
After consultation with the NCC, a full communication plan, including print, radio and online communication, will be rolled out at the soonest possible time, to reach consumers who have Enterprise products in their home, the statement informed.
Mc Dougal’s statement concluded by saying they have contacted all their customers to confirm that the recalled products are removed from store shelves.
