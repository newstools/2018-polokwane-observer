South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) Provincial Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson Messina Masekoameng and Judy Mphelane have been placed on precautionary suspension with effect from yesterday (Thursday). The move comes little less than a month before the structure’s national conference.
In a media statement Provincial Secretary Theo Makola said the process has been triggered by their inability to furnish concrete representations on why they should not be suspended for a variety of alleged gross violations of the Constitution, the organisation’s code of conduct and core principles.
From the media release it was learnt that the violations levelled against the two office-bearers include the alleged bringing into disrepute the name of the organisation, running a parallel administration outside the constitutionally recognised provincial structures of the organisation, misuse of organisational funds without approval and issuing media statements without due mandate from the provincial secretariat or structure.
