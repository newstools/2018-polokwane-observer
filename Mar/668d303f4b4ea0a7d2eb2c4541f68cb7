The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development commended the efforts and contributions of disabled farmers towards food security, job creation, economic growth and poverty alleviation during a departmental seminar held in Polokwane on Tuesday.
Agriculture and Rural Development spokesperson Selby Makgotho said the seminar was attended by farmers with disabilities from all the districts. “These farmers are playing a huge role in the economy, irrespective of their disability. Some of these farmers have employed disabled persons at their farms and it is amazing. They don’t see their disability as an impediment and as the department we appreciate their efforts towards economic emancipation in the agricultural sector,” Makgotho said.
He explained that they had invited stakeholders such as Eskom and the Department of Labour, farming institutions and various agricultural markets to the seminar with the aim of equipping farmers with knowledge, share their expertise with them and link them to the markets. “These are some of the stakeholders that will help them go forward.”
He said that among the role players there were officials from Eskom who shared information on the usage of electricity and that the farmers were eager to learn more. “It was an important and informative session for them because they work with electricity for agricultural production. With the involvement of the Department of Labour we wanted them to acquaint and familiarise themselves with labour law compliance. Remember they are not like most of us, it is difficult for them to visit such institutions when they need information so we thought we should bring the information to them,” Makgotho said.
