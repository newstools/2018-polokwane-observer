Angry customers are gathered outside the premises of Enterprise Foods in Polokwane demanding refunds for products bought from the facility’s factory outlet following the announcement that the source of the recent nationwide listeria outbreak had been traced to ready-to-eat meat products from the local factory.
Fuming customers are threatening to force entry into the premises if Enterprise’s management does not address or refund them. One of the customers, Kate Mokgobu said security guards on the premises told her that the management could only attend to customers’ grievances after 17:00 but she was not given valid reasons. Vehicles belonging to the company’s employees and those of service providers are denied entry by customers.
Seipei Rasethaba, owner of a bunny chow business in the city, recently bought ready-to-eat products worth more than R2 000. He said the listeria saga has affected his business badly and all he expects from Enterprise Foods is his refund.
Although the customers divulged that Enterprise Foods products are affordable and tasty, some vowed never to support the brand again.
A notice stating that ‘This shop will be closed until further notice’ is displayed on the doors of the factory shop. More updates to follow.
