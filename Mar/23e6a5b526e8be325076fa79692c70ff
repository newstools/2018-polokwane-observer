Head Coach of Polokwane City Football Club, Bernard Molekwa described their match against Ma­ritzburg United planned for 16 March at Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg as one of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches that will determine their stay in the elite league.
City is currently at the bottom of the league with 24 points after 22 matches and a loss against Maritzburg could see them moving down to 15th position.
In the first round of the PSL campaign last year November the two teams played to an exciting 0-0 draw at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
Despite the current form of Maritzburg in the league, Molekwa remains confident that they can defeat the PSL title chasers.
The Pietermaritzburg outfit is sitting comfortably in 4th position with 35 points. Victory against City could therefore see them moving to third position. “It is going to be a tough match. It is their home game and they always do well at home. They have a good coach and good players. It is not going to be an easy match but we will have to win the duel and move further in the league. We are not in a good position at all. We are scared because all the matches are tough and it is not easy to get points but we will continue fighting,” Molekwa said.
He stated that they could have won their match against Golden Arrows which resulted in a 2-2 draw at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday but they were let down by poor finishing and lack of tactical organisation. “We gave them too much space in the middle of the park and we could not convert our chances,” Molekwa said.
