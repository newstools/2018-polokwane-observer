As expected traffic volumes on the N1 are increasing by the hour and as millions of people are making their way to Limpopo high numbers of vehicles have been passing through the Kranskop Toll Plaza since early this morning (Thursday).
Spokesperson of the Department of Transport and Community Safety Matome Moremi-Tauyatswala said an average of 1 100 vehicles were counted at Kranskop between 07:00 and 09:00. The latest count was 1 561 vehicles travelling North at 11:00.
He indicated that a highly congested N1 is the possible result of an earlier roadblock conducted just outside Polokwane which has since been dismantled to increase traffic flow. “We also received reports of an earlier accident on the N1 between Modimolle and Tobias where three people were killed and which might also have caused the current congestion,” Moremi-Tauyatswala said.
He reiterated that motorists should be tolerant on the road and refrain from speeding or negligent driving.
He could not give any details on three lanes being used for traffic in a northern direction and only one lane for those travelling South.
