The impact of a collision between two vehicles at the corner of Church and Marshall streets during the lunch hour on Tuesday sent one vehicle flipping over and rolling on for some distance before landing on its roof near the bridge over Sterkloop Spruit. The other vehicle was also propelled for some metres down Church Street.
Eyewitnesses alleged that the driver of the overturned vehicle and his two passengers had suffered serious injuries and were rushed to hospital. The driver of the other car was reportedly unharmed. The eyewitnesses also alleged that the driver of the overturned vehicle had picked up two hitchhikers in an area serviced by taxis who then gave chase resulting in the driver speeding to get away from fuming taxidrivers and skipping the traffic light.
Polokwane Police spokesperson Lesiba Ramoshaba confirmed that the 32-year-old male driver and his two female passengers, aged 20 and 21 respectively, had sustained serious injuries.
He added that the female driver of the other vehicle escaped without injuries. Ramoshaba said the Police were investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving and stressed that they would rely on information to be obtained from the two drivers, passengers and witnesses to resolve the case.
