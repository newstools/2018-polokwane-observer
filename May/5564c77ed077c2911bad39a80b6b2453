While at the centre of the controversy surrounding the International Association of Athletics Federation’s proposed new set of rules for athletes with hyperandrogenism, South African middle distance runner Caster Semenya is on the ballot of the United States Sports Academy’s (Ussa) Athlete of the Month for April.
The nomination was motivated by the gold medal performances she delivered at the recent Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia where she broke a 34-year-old South African national record and won the 1 500 m title in a time of 4:00.71. She is up against renowned athletes such as the United States of America’s (USA) college footballer Donte di Vincenzo, professional ice hockey player Jake Guentzel, professional basketball player Lebron James, professional baseball player Sean Manaea, professional golfer Patrick Reed and Japanese marathon runner, Yuki Kawauchi.
Nominations are currently open and Sport, Arts and Culture MEC, Onicca Moloi has wished Semenya well for her nomination and urged citizens to vote for her on the academy’s website. “We are proud of her and her achievements. She is the only African athlete to be nominated and we are saying to her she must continue with the good work and keep on flying the African flag high,” Moloi said.
A media release issued by Ussa stated the award is part of the academy’s Awards of Sport programme, which each year serves as ‘a tribute to the artist and the athlete’. “The academy presents the awards to pay tribute to those who have made significant contributions to sport, in categories as diverse as the artist and the athlete in several different arenas of sport,” the statement read.
The awards honour exemplary achievement in coaching, all-around athletic performance, courage, humanitarian activity, fitness, and media, among others.
To cast a vote on the academy’s website go to www.ussa.edu.
