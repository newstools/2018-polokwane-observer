Learners of Noorderland High School gathered in the hall recently to donate blood during an SANBS donor clinic, with several first timers deciding to take the plunge and help save lives by doing so. One such learner was Nonhlanhla Ndimande, whose twin sister Nozipho convinced her to donate blood for the first time. “It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be and I will be a regular donor from now on,” Nonhlanhla said.
