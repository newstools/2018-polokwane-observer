Grade 4 to 7 learners of Mitchell House presented their projects at the annual Science Fair that was hosted in the school’s theatre on Friday.
Aspiring scientists were given the opportunity to explain the details of their projects to fellow learners and also to obtain credits for practical work in Science.
A solar ‘Purifikator’, a plant phototropism experiment, an enviro battery and an environmentally friendly solar shower system were some of the interesting projects that were on show. Grade 6s Moshibudi Manyaka and Skyla Bell demonstrated how the colour of light affects plants, while Grade 5 learner, Lethabo Chelopa demonstrated her hand lotion made from common ingredients like water at room temperature, organic virgin coconut oil and petroleum jelly.
Organiser of the fair, Kerry Spratt, explained that the aim of the event was to encourage learners to take risks with their projects and experience the outcomes. “It is an extension of what they do in class and they had to put in a lot of research, innovation and hard work to see the results. We focus on the whole development of our learners and I believe that it is also a learning opportunity which enhances interest in science as such,” Spratt said and added that she was delighted to see how learners develop from year to year and become more competent at analysing data and coming to conclusions.
