Twelve persons were expected to appear in the Giyani Magistrate’s Court yesterday (Wednesday) on suspicion of contravening the Precious Metal Act after they were arrested by the Limpopo Hawks at Mapuve village on Tuesday.
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that the suspects were arrested during an intelligence-driven operation by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit aimed at dealing with illegal processing of minerals.
During the operation the Hawks uncovered backyard gold processing laboratories and seized gold mining equipment which include gas cylinders, generators, gold bearing materials, mercury, automatic and manually operated pendukas, industrial hammers, gold bearing material grinders, wheelbarrows and industrial flash lights with an estimated value of more than R1,5 million, according to Maluleke.
Investigations continue.
