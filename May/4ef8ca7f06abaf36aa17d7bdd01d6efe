A huge turnout by learners in support of an effort to supplement the ever increasing demand for blood and blood products characterised the South African National Blood Services (SANBS) Polokwane’s blood drive at Capricorn High School on Tuesday.
Cappies educator and blood drive organiser, Irma van der Merwe indicated that they were targeting to donate 58 units of blood but emphasised that they usually exceed their target. She said they host blood drives once every term and reiterated that last year they managed to donate 240 units, placing them fourth position in the Capricorn district. Van der Merwe indicated that they love giving life and urged people to support blood drives.
Cappies blood buddy co-captain Tshiamo Metja said they were excited about the turnout and encouraged Cappies parents to support their blood drives for the school to donate more units of blood. First time donor Rijoy Mampa indicated that her uncle who suffered from tuberculosis and needed a lot of blood before his death and that was why she decided to become a blood donor.
She said it was of profound importance for people who qualify to donate blood to do so because there are people who need blood the most. Rijoy pledged to become a regular blood donor and stated that she would motivate her peers to do the same.
