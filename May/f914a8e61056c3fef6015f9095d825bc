Two National Traffic Police officers are expected to appear in the Mookgophong Magistrate’s Court tomorrow (Thursday) after they were arrested on charges of corruption by members of the Limpopo Hawks Serious Corruption Investigating Unit yesterday (Tuesday).
Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke indicated that the alleged offenders, aged 29 and 30, were arrested after they allegedly demanded R200 from an undercover cop in order not to issue him with a fine. The Hawks made the arrest the moment the officials accepted the bribe money, according to Maluleke.
