The estate agents of Aïda Polokwane decided to give the gift of life on Valentine’s Day, last Wednesday, by donating water to the drought stricken Western Cape. Anton Hanekom, Principal of Aïda Polokwane, said the water would be taken to the collection point at Uniclox in Marshall Street from where it will be distributed to communities who need it most.
