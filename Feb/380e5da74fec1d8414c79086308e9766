n 18-year-old learner from Malebogo outside Seshego is expected to appear in the Senwabarwana Magistrate’s Court next week on a charge of murder following the death of a fellow learner from a stab wound allegedly effected by the accused on Wednesday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the suspect was remanded in custody after his appearance in court yesterday (Thursday) and was expected to apply for bail on 2 March.
Ngoepe said the two learners apparently had an argument in a classroom when one produced a sharp object and stabbed his classmate. The injured learner was immediately taken to a local clinic where he was certified dead on arrival.
He advised parents and guardians to ensure children do not take any kind of weapons to school to prevent similar incidents in future.
Investigations continue.
