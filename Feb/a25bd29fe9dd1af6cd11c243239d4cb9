The Olifantspoort Plant is back in operation since yesterday (Thursday) morning and the levels of the reservoirs in the city have rehabilitated to such an extent that water supply to some consumers in the city was restored.
Spokesperson for Lepelle Northern Water (LNW), Simon Mpamonyane explained that although LNW is pumping water to the city at full capacity, reservoir levels will take some hours to rehabilitate because consumers are using water at the same time. Mpamonyane also confirmed this morning (Friday) that security measures at the plant will be intensified to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment after members of the Maijane community protested at the plant on Wednesday. Lepelle Northern Water (LNW) engaged with the community and the protest action was called off,” Mpamonyane said. According to Mpamonyane, the community claimed that they did not receive enough water, while other areas get preference. “This is not true. We implement water scheduling to our bulk customers according to their quotas and the availability of water and the capacity of the pipes that are feeding the reservoirs,” Mpamonyane explained and added that LNW will also engage with Lepelle Nkumpi Municipality to limit water leaks in its reticulation system.
Mpamonyane was not at liberty to disclose details of the planned security intervention.
