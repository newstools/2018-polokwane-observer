Grade R learners Phoebe Mahlaela and Mosa Sithole were crowned Mini Miss and Mini Mr Pemps 2018 during Pietersburg English Medium Primary School’s (Pemps) Valentine’s Day celebration last Thursday.
The duo beat 64 learners who participated in the pageant to win the coveted titles.
Congratulating the learners, Karen Adlem, Principal for Pemps Grade R said the two learners showed confidence on the ramp and brilliant personalities. “This is an annual event which we use to celebrate Valentine’s Day and allow learners to showcase their modelling skills. We are proud of the two winners. This is a great achievement for them and wish them all the best in other school’s activities,’ Adlem said.
