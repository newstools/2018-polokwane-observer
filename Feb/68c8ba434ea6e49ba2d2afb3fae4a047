The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo’s call to residents and businesspersons in the province to donate five and ten litre bottles of water to later be delivered to Cape Town is being heeded and so far close to 18 000 litres of water have been collected.
“We need as much water as can be spared, so please don’t stop sending us water,” was DA Provincial Leader Jacques Smalle’s message on Tuesday.
Water can be delivered to the DA offices at 79 Hans van Rensburg Street from 08:00 to 17:00 on weekdays or at the parking area of the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday before 12:00 from where the water will be transported to Cape Town by Gift of the Givers.
