The award-winning Jaguar F-TYPE is now available in South Africa with a new 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder Ingenium engine. The most powerful four-cylinder engine ever fitted to a Jaguar boasts superb performance, with outputs of 221kW and 400Nm propelling the F-TYPE from a standstill to 100km/h in just 5.7 seconds – and on to a top speed of 250km/h.
The pairing of Jaguar’s all-aluminium two-seat sports car with the advanced 221kW 2.0-litre turbocharged power plant delivers Jaguar sports car DNA with enhanced agility and improved efficiency and affordability. This is a true F-TYPE, with its own unique character.
Lisa Mallett, Marketing Director, Jaguar Land Rover South Africa and sub-Sahara Africa said:
“F-TYPE has proven popular among South Africans, offering a combination of seductive styling, distinct character and sports car performance. This new 2.0-litre engine broadens the appeal of the F-TYPE range and makes it more accessible than ever before, while still offering buyers all the traits that have made F-TYPE a success.”
Launched at the world-famous Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit, the new entry point into the F-TYPE range had an opportunity to show off its sports car DNA. Fitted with Jaguar’s 2.0-litre Ingenium engine, the F-TYPE is 52kg lighter. Combined with bespoke chassis tuning, it offers drivers enhanced dynamics and agility.
The four-cylinder charged F-TYPE completes the 2018 model year F-TYPE line-up, joining the 423kW supercharged V8 F-TYPE SVR, 405kW F-TYPE R, 294kW F-TYPE 400 SPORT, 280kW F-TYPE S and 250kW F-TYPE – in both Coupé and Convertible body styles, as well as the R-Dynamic trim level.
Customers can build their own F-TYPE using the Jaguar Configurator. All new Jaguar cars come with the Jaguar Five-Year Care Plan: a five-year/100 000km service plan, a five-year/100 000km maintenance plan and a five-year/100 000km warranty, as standard.
