A Police officer was killed and another critically injured after an accident in an armoured vehicle outside Lebowakgomo earlier today (Friday).

Provincial Provincial Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba visited the scene and has on behalf of the provincial Police management and members conveyed his condolences to the family, relatives, friends and colleagues. He also wished the injured member a speedy recovery.
The name of the deceased wil be made known as soon as his next of kin has been notified.
