Unforeseen circumstances prevented Polokwane magistrate Janine Ungerer from delivering judgement in the bail application of double murder accused Rameez Patel earlier today (Friday).
Ungerer tendered an apology indicating that she was unable to finalise her judgement and that it would be handed down next week.
Patel is standing trial in the Polokwane High Court for allegedly murdering his wife, Fatima in April 2015. His bail application before Ungerer in the Polokwane Magistrateâ€™s Court applies to the death of his mother Mahjebeen in September 2017, in which case he is a murder suspect.
