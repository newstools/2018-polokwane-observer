Following a series of attacks on filling stations in the province, another incident in which nine suspects allegedly stormed and robbed the Sasol filling station on the R71 in Tzaneen after blasting the drop-safe, was reported earlier this morning (Friday).
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the incident occurred at about 03:20. An employee alleged that nine armed suspects stormed the shop and bombed the drop-safe. They also robbed a fast food restaurant attached to the filling station, Ngoepe said.
They fled the scene in a Toyota Corolla and a BWM with an unknown amount of cash. No shots were fired and no-one injured, according to Ngoepe.
Investigations continue.
