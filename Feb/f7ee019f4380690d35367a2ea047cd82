A Limpopo presence in Cabinet was reinforced when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a much anticipated reshuffle last night.
Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, who served as Minister of International Relations and Cooperation after her tenure as MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs in Limpopo, made way for former Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu.
Nkoana-Mashabane was moved to Rural Development and Land Reform, while Sisulu was replaced by Nomaindia Mfeketo.
Newcomers to the scene are Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba, ex-MEC of different portfolios in Limpopo who was slotted into the position of Minister of State Security, former Limpopo Premier Cassel Mathale who was given the job of Deputy Minister of Small Business Development as well as former Limpopo Transport MEC Pinky Kekana who is the new Deputy Minister of Communications.
Faith Muthambi and Joe Maswanganyi, both key figures from Limpopo, had to vacate the positions of Ministers of Communications and Transport to make way for Nomvula Mokonyane and Blade Nzimande.
Earlier on Nzimande was removed as Higher Education and Training Minister by Ramaphosaâ€™s predecessor. The position is now being held by Naledi Pandor.
