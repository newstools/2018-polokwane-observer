The body of a driver whose auto carrier truck plunged into a fast flowing river at Chuenespoort on Tuesday evening was retrieved by members of the Police Search and Rescue Unit yesterday (Wednesday) morning.
Provincial Police Corporate Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the driver of the truck had supposedly lost control during heavy rain on the R37 at Chuenespoort. The truck partially plunged into a river and the search and rescue team was called to the scene at about 22:00. Members from Emergency Medical Services as well as the local fire brigade worked tirelessly into the early hours of yesterday (Wednesday) morning to retrieve the body from the wreckage.
Mojapelo further indicated that three passengers were injured and taken to hospital.
Mojapelo said the rescue team had to work under extremely dangerous conditions aggravated by the dark, heavy rains and high water volumes during the rescue mission.
The name of the deceased will be released once the next of kin have been informed.
Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba commended the team for their dedication and selfless, relentless efforts to assist others without thinking of their own safety. He warned motorists to be cautious in misty and rainy conditions and cautioned community members in the rural areas not to cross fast flowing rivers or streams.
