What seems to be a repeat of previous years’ chaos and maladministration once again saw disgruntled athletes and officials from primary and high schools from across the province leaving the old Peter Mokaba Stadium after the Limpopo Schools Athletics circuit meeting failed to start on time earlier today (Wednesday).
At 10:42, almost three hours after the set time for the first event at 08:00, athletes and coaches were still loitering around the stadium while officials were apparently engaged in a meeting.
“I do not know who is in charge or who to speak to. My athletes are leaving because of the poor planning and organisation they are exposed to once again,” a coach indicated, adding his concern about the heat athletes in the 5 000 m and 3 000 m would have to endure due to the late start.
An official told Polokwane Observer telephonically that he had gone home. “They are wasting valuable time which not only impacts on officials and parents but most importantly on athletes’ performance,” he said.
Comment from Department of Education Spokesperson Sam Makondo is still being awaited.
