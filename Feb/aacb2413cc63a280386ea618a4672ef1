Following the dissolving of the executive of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Waterberg Region, a regional task team (RTT) has been formalised.
This follows a meeting of the ANC’s Provincial Working Committee (PWC) on Monday.
In a media statement just received from the ANC in Limpopo, ANC Provincial Secretary Nocks Seabi announced the names of the task team members. The task team comprises of Kgabo Mahoai as the convenor, Pat Mathale as coordinator, Andrew Dipale, Nelly Sekhale, Morris Matataboge, Tolly Mashamaite, Sara Lamola, Meisie Maeko, Zack Maeko, Mike Rapatso, Andrima Matsemela, Jabu Mthombeni and Gloria Seleka.
“This RTT has been mandated to rebuild and strengthen the organisation in the region and ensure that the region convenes a regional conference within three months,” Seabi remarked.
