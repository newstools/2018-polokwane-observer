The trial of Rameez Patel who stands accused of allegedly killing his wife Fatima at their home in Nirvana in April 2015, will continue in the Limpopo High Court in July.
The case was postponed on Wednesday to 9 and 10 July as well as 16 to 20 July in order for Patel’s newly appointed attorney Johann Engelbrecht to acquaint himself with the merits of the case. It was also learnt that the postponed date was the only time on which presiding officer Joseph Raulinga would be available.
Patel also appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday in connection with the alleged killing of his mother Mahjebeen at her home in Nirvana in September last year.
The case was postponed to 30 July pending the Director of Public Prosecution’s decision to continue prosecuting Patel alone in the matter as his co-accused and alleged hitman, Charles Chialana escaped from custody last year and could not be traced since. Chialana is allegedly hiding in Zimbabwe.
