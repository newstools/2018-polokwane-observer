In a joint statement alliance structures in the province have announced memorial activities for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who passed away on Monday.
In a statement the alliance secretariat referred to alliance structures in Limpopo – the African National Congress (ANC), the South African Communist Party (SACP), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) – having had a joint meeting on Wednesday to reflect on the great loss that had befallen the nation.
Alliance structures developed a programme of memorial activities to be undertaken until the burial day, which includes the opening of a condolence book at Frans Mohlala House and a wreath-laying ceremony by a mass of women to be led by the provincial leadership of the ANC Women’s League today (Friday).
A provincial memorial service is scheduled for Monday to be held at Jack Botes hall in Polokwane at noon.
Provincial leaders are expected to join the national memorial service while transport had been arranged for members to attend the funeral at Orlando Stadium next Saturday, according to the statement.
