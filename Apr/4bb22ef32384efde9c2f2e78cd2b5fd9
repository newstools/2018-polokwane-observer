Nakedi Mathebula and Simon Ramela, accused in the alleged murder of Nakedi’s husband, William Mathebula at his home in Flora Park in February, briefly appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court this morning (Friday) after which the case was postponed to next week for a bail application.
The duo appeared in the same court yesterday (Thursday) following the cold blooded murder of local businessman and owner of Thaba Protection Services, William Mathebula when three suspects allegedly forced his 11-year-old son and domestic worker into a room with him where he was shot on 20 February.
Provincial Police Corporate Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that a team of Polokwane detectives, assisted by the Provincial Tracking Team, followed up on information received which led to a sting operation in Lephalale last Tuesday night. During the operation Ramela, also a businessperson, was arrested. Intense investigations then led Police to Mathebula’s house in Flora Park where she was apprehended on Tuesday, it was learnt.
A pistol with ten live rounds of ammunition and two vehicles were confiscated during the arrests, Mojapelo stated.
Police are also calling on Victor Mashakeng to avail himself at any Police station as it is believed he will be able to assist in the investigation. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Mashakeng can contact investigating officers Linkie Mathebula on 064 756 8218 or Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501.
