The success attained by the Police’s Operation Fiela II conducted across the province on a weekly basis continued when several suspects on varied charges last week were apprehended.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe highlighted some of the arrests and said a joint operation which focussed on crime syndicates involved in hijackings and burglaries in the Seshego Cluster yielded positive results.
Seven suspects, aged between 21 and 34, arrested in Seshego, Moletjie and Clayville will face charges of burglary and possession of suspected stolen properties. They may also be linked to various other cases in and around Seshego, Giyani and Musina. Two BMWs, an Isuzu bakkie and a Toyota Corolla were confiscated. It is believed that the vehicles were destined to be smuggled into Zimbabwe. One of them was reported stolen in Chatsworth, KwaZulu-Natal recently, according to Ngoepe.
Police also arrested three suspects in the Apel policing area for hijacking and possession of suspected stolen properties and stolen vehicles. During the arrest Police recovered a firearm which was reported stolen in Lebowakgomo recently and a Toyota Hilux reported stolen in Boksburg, Gauteng recently.
Ngoepe stated that another suspect was arrested in Jane Furse after being found in possession of an Audi which was stolen in Belfast, Mpumalanga recently.
Police have also embarked on Operation Zonke in Mahwelereng Policing area where three suspects were arrested for possession of drugs. Over 200 sachets of nyaope as well as rocks and dagga were confiscated, Ngoepe said.
He added that a 23-year-old man was arrested at Dan Village on charges of possession of dagga and impersonating a Police officer. Packets of dagga and a fake Police identification card were found in his possession.
Ngoepe warned that similar operations will continue on a regular basis in an effort to fight crime across the province.
