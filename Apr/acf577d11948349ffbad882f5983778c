A man who killed his paternal grandmother in cold blood, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Limpopo High Court on Tuesday after the presiding judge could not find compelling reasons to impose a lighter sentence.
William Lebogo pleaded guilty to the charge of murdering Maputhi Lebogo at Ga-Mashashane on 21 August, 2016. According to a report from the pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination, she died of “Blunt force trauma to her head” and Lebogo admitted in a sworn statement that was submitted as evidence, that he inflicted wounds on his grandmother with a stone as well as a panga.

The accused alleged that he killed his grandmother after he saw her pouring some liquid into a container and suspected that she was responsible for the earlier death of his mother who, according to his statement, suffered from pains of the legs. He said that he wanted an explanation from his grandmother about his mother’s death, but she refused to oblige. He also suspected that she bewitched him because she was a sangoma, Lebogo explained in the sworn statement.
In passing sentence, Judge George Phatudi said that the accused violated the deceased’s right to life and that his conduct was found to be pre-meditated murder. “The court could not find any compelling reasons to impose a lighter sentence than life imprisonment,” Phatudi said and explained that although he was a first offender, the court had to balance the severity of the crime, the interests of the community and the accused’s personal circumstances before arriving at a just sentence.
