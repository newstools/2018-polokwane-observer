Power supply to Eduan Park has been interrupted since early this morning (Friday), but Polokwane Municipality is confident that residents will not be left in the dark over the weekend.
This comes after power supply was also disrupted for a whole day and until the late hours of the evening last week due to a cable fault. The municipality could then not indicate how long it would have taken to rectify the fault.
Spokesperson for the municipality, Disree Manyane confirmed at 10:30 that today’s power outage is also due to a cable fault. “Repairs are expected to be completed by 18:00 this afternoon,” Manyane said.
Manyane offered the municipality’s apologies to residents who are affected by the power outage caused by “unforeseen circumstances”.
