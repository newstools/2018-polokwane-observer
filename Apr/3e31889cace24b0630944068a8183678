The N1 South between Polokwane and Mokopane is currently closed for traffic due to a collision that left two people dead and two Police officials injured, one critically, when their vehicles – a Police van and a blue Volkswagen Polo, collided head-on some 14 km outside Polokwane this morning.
Provincial Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe was on the scene and made a request to motorists to use the R101. “It will still take some time to clear the scene,” he added. He further said those involved in the collision could not yet be identified until their next of kin were notified.
