The recent 15th Absa Cape Epic mountain bike race staged in the Western Cape was of particular interest to Stanford Lake College (SLC) as the school’s mixed team of Steve Willson and Melanie Melvile made their way across 653 km of rough terrain in the Western Cape to finish in an impressive 38th position with an overall time of 44:31.01,3.
Willson, the school’s High Performance Centre manager and Melville, a well-known local athlete and parent of the school, were among the select 650 two-man teams whose entries were accepted for this year’s event
The race comprised eight days of riding with 13 530 m of accumulated climbing and including four consecutive days of over 100 km each. While they described the race as a huge physical and mental challenge Willson and Melville said they had thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
The Absa Cape Epic is the only eight-day mountain bike stage race classed as hors catégorie (HC) by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). HC is a French term used in stage bicycle races to designate a climb that is ‘beyond categorisation’.
Steve Willson and Melanie Melville negotiate a steep part of the route.
