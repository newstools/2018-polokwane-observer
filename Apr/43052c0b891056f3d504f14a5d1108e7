Former Bafana Bafana Coach, Shakes Mashaba as well as South African soccer legends Khabo Zondo and Mike Mangena are expected in Polokwane tomorrow (Friday) to oversee the 2018 Nedbank Cup Keyona team search trials in the province at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.
The trials are expected to draw scores of aspiring soccer players who’d be hoping that their skills and talent will set them apart from the others and possibly ensure inclusion in the Nedbank Keyona final team to be announced in June.
According to a statement issued by the organisers of the event, selected players countrywide will go through rigorous selection criteria at the next phase of the competition, a boot camp scheduled for June this year.
“The final team will be drafted into Premier Soccer League (PSL) teams after playing at the Keyona Challenge against the 2018 Nedbank Cup winners.
“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for aspiring professional soccer players. Nedbank has always believed in the need to invest in football and football development, as this is one of South Africa’s many passion points. The Ke Yona match is only the beginning of their road towards a successful footballing career that could change their lives,” the statement read.
Players between 18 and 35 years of age and in possession of a valid South African identity document may enter.
The trials are expected to start at 08:00 and the names of selected players is set to be announced at 17:00.
