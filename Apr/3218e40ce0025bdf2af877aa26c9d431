Motorists using light motor vehicles (Class 1) will pay R15,50 more in toll fees for a trip on the N1 between Pretoria and Beit Bridge from today (Thursday).
The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) recently announced its annual toll fee increase of approximately 6,5% and it is applicable to all classes of vehicles.
Light motor vehicles with or without a trailer will now pay R250,50 for a one-way trip, compared to the fee of R235,00 that was applicable from 3 March 2017 to yesterday (Wednesday).
In Class 4 (Vehicles with more than four axles), operators will now pay R941,00 for the trip, compared to R884,00 that was applicable for the past year.
A local motorist who uses a portion of the route on a daily basis, commented that although the new tariffs may have a minimal effect on non-frequent users, it may result in a noticeable effect for daily users and operators using the road for distribution of goods.
