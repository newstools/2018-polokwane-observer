Police are investigating a case of arson after the municipal licensing offices at Mookgophong were, amid an investigation into alleged fraud and corruption, set alight early on Tuesday.
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that security guards noticed flames coming from the roof of the reception area at about 02:30. They immediately informed their manager who summoned the Police, traffic management and fire brigade. On their arrival the reception office was reportedly already engulfed in flames.
Modimolle-Mookgophong Local Municipality Mayor Marlene van Staden has strongly condemned the incident. “While the reasons for the alleged torching of the office are still to be determined, it is highly concerning that the section targeted is the same one that was shut down earlier this month by the Department of Transport and Community Safety’s Anti-Fraud and Corruption Unit. A number of municipal officials have been implicated in allegations of wrong-doing in the issuing of drivers and learner’s licences,” she said in a press release.
A full investigation into the fire has been launched and the specialised arson forensic team from Gauteng will lead the investigation.
Van Staden assured all residents that they will not rest until corruption has been rooted out and the criminals involved been brought to book.
