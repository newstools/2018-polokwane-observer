And so Polokwane adventurer Sarel Nong and Team South Africa conquered the big daddy.
The South African team that set out to climb Mount Everest with mountaineer Sibusiso Vilane in the beginning of April has reached their final destination yesterday (Thursday) afternoon and after a nightâ€™s rest in Kathmandu, Nong was already back in the gym this morning.
In a brief exchange of text messages this morning he said it was great to be back in Kathmandu and breathing normally again after having ascended to extreme heights along the route. He said the team members, minus Vilane who continued with a solitary mission of reaching the summit without oxygen, had a bath and a meal upon arrival in Kathmandu.
Nong is expected back in Polokwane on Sunday morning.
