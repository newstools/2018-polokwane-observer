As commuters are bracing themselves for the effects of the looming national bus strike that is anticipated midnight, Great North Transport (GNT) in Limpopo has advised passengers to make alternative arrangements to reduce the impact on travelling schedules.
In a media statement released by GNT’s Marketing and Communications Division this morning, GNT Chief Executive Officer Sandile Keswa was quoted saying that as a passenger transport company the strike would have a negative effect on the mobility of their commuters and passengers across their eleven depots. “Our wish is for the strike to be resolved at the earliest possible time to minimise its impact.”
It was stated that passengers would be kept informed of any developments regarding the strike.
