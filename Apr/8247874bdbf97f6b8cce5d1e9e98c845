The trio was expected to apply for bail but the case was postponed to 26 April for formal bail application.
Provincial Police Corporate Communications Head Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that Matlala, the third susect in the case, was arrested at Olifantsfontein outside Tembisa following intensive investigations by Polokwane detectives and the Provincial Tracking Team yesterday (Wednesday).
Mojapelo added that Nakedi was facing a charge of conspiracy to commit murder while Ramela and Matlala were being charged with murder.

Mojapelo referred to the day of the killing indicating that local businessperson and owner of Thaba Protection Services, William Mathebula was shot and killed in cold blood at his home in Flora Park in February. Mathebula’s son who was waiting at the gate to go to school at around 07:10 was reportedly confronted by three suspects who allegedly pushed him into the house where they encountered the domestic worker and then pushed both into a room with the victim. Without saying a word they allegedly shot him several times in front of his son and the domestic worker before fleeing the scene.
