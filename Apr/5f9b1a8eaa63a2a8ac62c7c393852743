Members and affiliates of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) marched to the Department of Labour’s provincial offices today (Wednesday) to protest against the proposed poverty-level national minimum wage of R20 an hour and amendments to labour laws which, according to them, will destroy workers’ constitutional right to strike.
Saftu opposes the idea that reviewing the R20 an hour poverty wage every year will in any way alter the fact that it will still be a poverty wage on which no-one should be expected to live.
A statement issued by the union stated that the national minimum wage of R20 an hour perpetuates and legitimises the unequal apartheid wage structure, as it will keep millions of workers mired in poverty and make South Africa an even more unequal society.
“Saftu demands that the Department of Labour does not just tinker with the details of the Bill but makes fundamental changes so that the minimum wage becomes a living wage, that it applies across the board with no exemptions and that it will be rigorously enforced,” the statement read.
