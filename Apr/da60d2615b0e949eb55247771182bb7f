Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) ward 13 councillor, Michael Ramaphoko who was arrested on a charge of common robbery on Friday appeared before Seshego Magistrate’s Court and was granted R1 000 bail.
Ramaphoko first appeared in court a day after his arrest when he was denied bail. The matter was postponed to 10 April but his lawyer reportedly requested the magistrate for an expedited date which was then set for 6 April.
Ramaphoko had allegedly robbed a victim, aged 29, of an undisclosed amount of money outside a tavern in Seshego on 25 March.
Provincial Police spokesperson, Moatshe Ngoepe earlier said the victim was drinking beer at a tavern when approached by the accused who took him out of the tavern and robbed him.
When contacted by Polokwane Observer Ramaphoko declined to comment telephonically.
