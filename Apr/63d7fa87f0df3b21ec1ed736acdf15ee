Baroka Football Club’s 2-1 loss against Premier Soccer League (PSL) title contenders Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday won’t dampen their aspirations of finishing the league in the top 8 bracket.
The club’s Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Mammilla is of the conviction that the Ga-Mphahlele based outfit will not allow any team to stand in their way.
Currently in position 8 of the PSL log with 33 points after 26 matches, they will need to collect maximum points against Maritzburg United, Ajax Cape Town, Bloemfontein Celtic and the relegation threatened Super Sport United whom they the face in the last four matches on the PSL season in order to achieve their goal .
“Our goal is still the same. We want to finish the league in the top 8 position and we can do it. We played well against Sundowns. It was a game of two halves. We were just let down by an injury to one of our key players, Talent Chawapiwa in the early minutes of the match. We had planned around him but things did not go according to the plan. But we will soldier on,” Mammila said.
He also said that the last remaining matches won’t be easy but winnable given the pedigree of the teams they will be playing with and their ambitions in the league. “Celtic also wants the top 8 finish and they are just behind us. Ajax and Super Sport United are fighting for relegation and they are under pressure. Teams under pressure don’t do well. It is up to us now and they players know that our objective is to finish the league in the top 8 bracket. We just have to focus and win those matches,” Mammila concluded.
